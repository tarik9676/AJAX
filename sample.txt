As far back as the early stirrings of the Cold War, the concept of a network connecting
computers was under development by both government and university researchers looking
for a better means to communicate and share research. The military at the time relied in
part on microwave transmission technology for communications. An unexpected attack on
some of these towers demonstrated how susceptible the technology was to failure of even
small portions of the transmission path. This led the military to seek a method of communicating
that could withstand attack. At the same time, university researchers were trying
to share their work between campuses, and were struggling with similar problems when
their transmissions suffered drops in signal. Parties from both groups ended up at the same
conference with presentations, and decided to collaborate in order to further their work.
At the time, computers were far from what we know them as today. A single computer
was a large, immobile assortment of equipment that took up an entire room. Data entry was
done by using punched cards of paper, or the newest method of the time, magnetic tapes.
Interacting with the computer meant reserving time on the equipment and traveling to
where it was. Most machines were owned by universities, large corporations, or government
organizations due to the staffing demands, size, and cost to acquire and maintain them. The
image below depicts the UNIVAC 1, a system used by the United States Census Bureau
and other large organizations like universities. One of the fastest machines at the time, it
could perform roughly 1000 calculations per second.
